	"steps": [
		"In a stand mixer, combine the sugar, salt, yeast, and 2 cups of flour. Pour the yeast and salt on opposite sides of the bowl to prevent the yeast from activating prematurely.",
		"In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the butter and water until it is very warm, but not hot. In my microwave, this takes 1 minute. The butter does not have to be completely melted.",
		"With the mixer on low speed with the paddle attachent, gradually beat in the warm mixture until just blended. Increase speed to medium and beat for another 2 minutes.",
		"Beat in the remaining flour to make a soft dough, scraping the sides of the bown as needed.",
		"Switch to the dough hook attachment and knead the bread for 5-7 mins until the dough is smooth and elastic.",
		"Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Cut the dough in half; cover and let rest for 20 mins.",
		"On a large baking sheet, lay down a silicone baking mat or spray with non-stick spray. Sprinkle with cornmeal (opt.)",
		"On a floured surface, roll one dough half into a 15×10\" rectangle. Starting at the long side, tightly roll the dough like a jelly-roll, and pinch the seam to seal. Repeat with the other dough half.",
		"Places the loaves seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet and taper the ends. Brush with vegetable oil or melted butter to prevent the dough from drying out during the rise.",
		"Cover loosely with plastic wrap, leaving no gaps around the edges, and refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.",
		"To bake, preheat oven to 425°F. Remove loaves from the fridge, uncover and let stand 10 minutes. Cut 3 or 4 diagonal slashes on top of each loaf. Bake for 20 minutes.",
		"In a small bowl, beat 1 egg white with 1 Tbsp water. Remove loaves from the oven. Brush evenly with the egg wash. Return to oven and bake for another 5 minutes.",
		"Allow bread to cool completely before storing in an airtight container."
